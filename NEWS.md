# nomiShape 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
* Provides tools to visualize and analyze nominal (categorical, unordered) variable distributions.
* Introduces novel centered bar and dot plots, which arrange categories from most frequent at the center outward, allowing detection of distributional patterns such as uniformity, dominance, symmetry, skewness, and long-tail behavior — an approach not previously available in R.
* Includes functions to plot, analyze, and perform model comparison using AIC for nominal data shapes.
* Main functions: `ranked_barplot()`, `centered_barplot()`, `centered_dotplot()`, `shape_comp_plot()`, `shape_aic()`.
* Designed for exploratory data analysis of nominal variables.
