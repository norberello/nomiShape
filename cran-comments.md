* This is a new release.
* The package contains synthetic datasets for examples (`categories`, `categories2`, `categories3`).
* Introduces centered bar and dot plots for nominal variable distributions; this design is intentional for pedagogical and analytical purposes.
* All required packages are on CRAN; no external system dependencies.
* Vignettes and examples run on current CRAN R versions.
* NOTE: The single note is related to timestamps and does not affect package functionality.
